# Unsupervised Segmentation Map Registration

This repository implements an unsupervised deep learning framework for registering a surface-derived segmentation template to a target segmentation volume. The model learns a 3D deformation field using volumetric similarity and smoothness constraints, without requiring paired training data. It supports multiple surface-aware loss functions and operates on medical datasets such as OASIS.

**Dataset**

We use the [Neurite-OASIS](https://github.com/adalca/medical-datasets/blob/master/neurite-oasis.md) brain MRI dataset. The `.npz` files are preprocessed into one-hot encoded `.npy` volumes using `convert_one_hot.py`. Each one-hot volume has **5 channels**, corresponding to:  
- Background  
- Cortex  
- Subcortical GM  
- White Matter  
- CSF

**Setup**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/karthiknm/Segmentation-Map-Registration.git
cd Segmentation-Map-Registration
pip install -r requirements.txt  # or install dependencies manually
```

---

**Training**

```bash
python train.py --train_txt path/to/train_npy_list.txt \
                --template_path path/to/template_seg_onehot.npy \
                --epochs 200 \
                --save_model_path ./weights/
```

The input to the model is constructed by concatenating the 5-channel template and 5-channel fixed map, resulting in a **10-channel input**. The U-Net is initialized with `in_channels=10`.

**Strategy (λ-Regularized Deformable Registration)**

We extend the registration network to predict both:
- A dense deformation field to align the moving/template segmentation map to the fixed/target map, and
- A per-location **λ map** (regularization strength) via an additional output head.

Key idea: instead of using a single global smoothness weight, the model learns **where** deformation should be rigid vs flexible using the segmentation labels (2D label maps). Regions that should remain more rigid (e.g., white matter) are encouraged to have higher λ, while more deformable regions (e.g., ventricles/CSF) are encouraged to have lower λ.

Implementation notes:
- The λ head uses a **softplus** activation to keep λ positive and numerically stable.
- The classic smoothness regularizer is replaced by a **label-weighted λ-smoothness**, where λ scales the gradient penalties spatially.
- Training is end-to-end using both MRI/segmentation inputs and available segmentation labels for λ supervision; at test time, the model can run without labels and still outputs the deformation field (and λ map) for interpretation.

**File Overview**

- `train.py`: Main training loop using U-Net and `SpatialTransformer`.
- `model.py`: Contains both the 3D U-Net and a `SpatialTransformer` using bilinear sampling.
- `losses.py`: Defines all atomic losses used for training (`dice_loss`, `bending_energy_loss`, `jacobian_det_loss`, etc.).
- `compoundlossfunction.py`: Combines multiple losses using a `loss_weights` dictionary — useful for experimentation, but **not used in the main training loop**.
- `get_data.py`: Loads `.npy` one-hot maps and resizes them to `(128, 128, 128)` using **nearest-neighbor interpolation**.
- `convert_one_hot.py`: Converts `.nii.gz` segmentations into 5-channel `.npy` format.
- `testing_loss.py`: Unit test to verify individual loss functions return valid outputs.

**Loss Functions Used**

The main training script (`train.py`) uses a predefined `composite_loss` function from `losses.py`, which includes:

Core registration losses:
- Dice Loss: encourages overlap between warped moving labels and fixed labels.
- Cross Entropy Loss: provides dense label supervision complementing Dice, stabilizing early training.

Deformation regularization:
- (λ-)Smoothness / Bending Energy Loss: penalizes non-smooth deformations; in the λ-regularized version, this penalty is spatially weighted by the learned λ map (higher λ → stronger smoothing).
- Jacobian Determinant Loss: discourages folding/invalid warps by penalizing negative or extreme local volume changes and my removing self-intersection.

Additional λ-map objectives (strategy component):
- λ-Supervision Loss: uses anatomical regions from labels (e.g., ventricles/CSF vs white matter) to encourage lower λ in flexible regions and higher λ in rigid regions.
- λ-Prior Loss (Gaussian/Beta): keeps λ bounded, smooth, and interpretable.
- Displacement Magnitude Loss: discourages unnecessarily large deformations and improves stability.

In addition, `compoundlossfunction.py` supports experimental loss combinations using:
- Chamfer Distance
- Hausdorff Distance
- Surface Distance
- Label Overlap Loss
- Deformation Direction Variation

**Notes**

- One fixed template is warped to match each subject's segmentation.
- The `SpatialTransformer` performs dense warping using bilinear interpolation on tensors in normalized coordinates.
- Label-preserving nearest-neighbor interpolation is used only during dataset resizing (`get_data.py`).
- Be sure to adjust paths and GPU IDs in `train.py` as needed.

**Logging**

Training progress is tracked using [Weights & Biases (wandb)](https://wandb.ai/). To disable, comment out or remove the `wandb.init()` call in `train.py`.

**Example Command**

```bash
python train.py --train_txt ./data/train_npy5.txt \
                --template_path ./data/OASIS_OAS1_0406_MR1/seg5_onehot.npy \
                --epochs 200 \
                --save_model_path ./weights/model.pth
```

**Results**

- Dice score: **99.64**
- λ-map visualization: use the predicted λ map to interpret where the model prefers rigid vs flexible deformation.
